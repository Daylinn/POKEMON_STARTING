# Pokemon Battle Simulator

## Overview

The Pokemon Battle Simulator is a Python-based project that simulates battles between Pokemon. It allows users to create and manage Pokemon trainers, each with their own team of Pokemon, and engage in turn-based battles following the rules and mechanics inspired by the popular Pokemon games.

## Features

- **Pokemon Class:** A Python class representing individual Pokemon. It includes attributes such as name, type, level, health, and status.

- **Trainer Class:** A Python class representing Pokemon trainers. Trainers can have up to 6 Pokemon in their team, use potions to heal their Pokemon, switch active Pokemon during battles, and engage in battles with other trainers.

- **Type Advantage:** The battle system takes into account type advantages and disadvantages (e.g., Fire vs. Water) when calculating damage dealt.

- **Experience Points:** Pokemon can gain experience points (XP) through battles and level up when they reach a certain XP threshold.

- **Evolution:** Some Pokemon can evolve into stronger forms when they reach a certain level.
